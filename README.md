We have built 4 new machines and we noticed that the antivirus definition (Defender) is outdated (2023). However, the AVDs remained compliant.

You will find in the link I sent the diagnostic logs and the screenshot of the AV definition.

As a reminder: itâ€™s the opposite. AVDs appear as non-compliant after the build, and the AV definition is outdated but only becomes compliant after a user authentication.

After our call last week, and to work around the issue, we created another compliance rule just for the AV, assigned only to those 4 machines.
